# Shifu Quarto templates

> Shīfù (師傅): Chinese; n. [expert
> instructor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shifu) or
> [father/teacher](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shifu)

------------------------------------------------------------------------

For a while now, I have been using [Andrew
Heiss’](https://www.andrewheiss.com/) custom LaTeX templates
[hikmah](https://github.com/andrewheiss/hikmah-academic-quarto/tree/main)
(which are also based off [Kieran Healy’s
template](https://github.com/kjhealy/latex-custom-kjh)). While I like
this template, I also want to develop my own have my own person style to
them.

Right now, this template is heavily inspired by [Andrew
Heiss’](https://www.andrewheiss.com/) template, essentially being a mix
between both the hikmah and hikmah-manuscript variant. In the future I
hope to add a few custom additions to this.

## Installation

Run this command to install the templates in your Quarto project:

``` bash
quarto add C-Monaghan/shifu-academic-quarto
```
