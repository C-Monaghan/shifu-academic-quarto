# Shifu Quarto templates

> Shīfù (師傅): Chinese; n. [expert instructor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shifu) or [father/teacher](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shifu)

---

For a while now, I have been using [Andrew Heiss'](https://www.andrewheiss.com/) custom LaTeX templates [hikmah](https://github.com/andrewheiss/hikmah-academic-quarto/tree/main) (which are also based off [Kieran Healy's template](https://github.com/kjhealy/latex-custom-kjh)). While I like this template, I also want to develop my own and have my own person style to them.

I have also really been enjoying learning [Typst](https://typst.app/docs/) and so this template is entirely written with Typst. Christopher Kenny's [ctk-article](https://github.com/christopherkenny/ctk-article/tree/main) was invaluable in helping me understand the file structure and how to pull meta data from YAML into Typst.

Right now, this template is heavily inspired by [Andrew Heiss'](https://www.andrewheiss.com/) template, essentially being a mix between both the hikmah and hikmah-manuscript variant. In the future I hope to add a few custom additions to this.
